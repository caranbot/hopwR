# Part 1 
## 1 Project 1: Weighted Dice

  - Over the course of the book, you will use R to build three virtual objects
    - a pair of dice that you can roll to generate random numbers
    - a deck of cards that you can shuffle and deal from
    - and a slot machine modeled after some real-life video lottery terminals
    
    - These projects provide concrete examples for learning all of the components of R programming: objects, data types, classes, notation, functions, environments, if trees, loops, and vectorization


## 2 The Very Basics
  - You will build a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers
  
## 2.1 The R User Interface

  - RStudio gives you a way to talk to your computer
  - R gives you a language to speak in
  - The RStudio interface is simple
  - The code you type is called a command


### Type in some commands 1
<font size="1">
```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 + 1
100:130
```
</font>

## 2.1 The R User Interface - Some Commands

```{r, echo = TRUE}
5-

1
```
```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
3 % 5
```

## 2.1 The R User Interface - Some Commands

```{r, echo = TRUE}
2 * 3
4 - 1
6 / (4 - 1)
```

## 2.1 The R User Interface - Exercise
### Magic with numbers

  - Choose any number and add 2 to it.
  - Multiply the result by 3.
  - Subtract 6 from the answer.
  - Divide what you get by 3.
  
## 2.1 The R User Interface - Exercise
### Solution
.tiny[
```{r}
10 + 2
12 * 3
36 - 6
30 / 3
```
]

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
