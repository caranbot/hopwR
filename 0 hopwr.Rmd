## 1 Project 1: Weighted Dice

  - Over the course of the book, you will use R to build three virtual objects
    - a pair of dice that you can roll to generate random numbers
    - a deck of cards that you can shuffle and deal from
    - and a slot machine modeled after some real-life video lottery terminals


## The R User Interface

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}

```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
