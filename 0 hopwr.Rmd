# Part 1 
## 1 Project 1: Weighted Dice

  - Over the course of the book, you will use R to build three virtual objects
    - a pair of dice that you can roll to generate random numbers
    - a deck of cards that you can shuffle and deal from
    - and a slot machine modeled after some real-life video lottery terminals
    
    - These projects provide concrete examples for learning all of the components of R programming: objects, data types, classes, notation, functions, environments, if trees, loops, and vectorization


## 2 The Very Basics
  - You will build a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers
  
## 2.1 The R User Interface

  - RStudio gives you a way to talk to your computer
  - R gives you a language to speak in
  - The RStudio interface is simple
  - The code you type is called a command


### Type in some commands 1
```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 + 1
100:130
```


## 2.1 The R User Interface - Some Commands

```{r, echo = TRUE}
5-
+
+ 1
```
```{r, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
3 % 5
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
2 * 3
6 / (4 - 1)
```

## 2.1 The R User Interface - Exercise
### Magic with numbers

  - Choose any number and add 2 to it.
  - Multiply the result by 3.
  - Subtract 6 from the answer.
  - Divide what you get by 3.
  
## 2.1 The R User Interface - Exercise
### Solution

```{r}
10 + 2
12 * 3
36 - 6
30 / 3
```

## 2.2 Objects

The : operator returns its results as a vector, a one-dimensional set of numbers.

```{r}
1:6
```

Running 1:6 generated a vector of numbers for you to see, but it didn’t save that vector anywhere in your computer’s memory.

You’ll have to ask your computer to save them somewhere. You can do that by creating an R object.

## 2.2 Objects

R lets you save data by storing it inside an R object.

What is an object?

Just a name that you can use to call up stored data.

```{r}
a <- 1
a

a + 2
```

## 2.2 Objects

Create an object named die

```{r}
die <- 1:6
die
```

Check the environment

## 2.2 Objects
### Naming rules 1
  - You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but there are a few rules. First, a name cannot start with a number. Second, a name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or *
  
## 2.2 Objects
### Naming rules 2   
  - R is case-sensitive, so name and Name will refer to different objects:
```{r}
Name <- 1
name <- 0

Name + 1
```
  - R will overwrite any previous information stored in an object without asking you for permission.
```{r}
my_number <- 1
my_number 

my_number <- 999
my_number
```

## 2.2 Objects
  - You can see which object names you have already used with the function ls:
```{r}
ls()
```

  - You can also see which names you have used by examining RStudio’s environment pane.




## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
